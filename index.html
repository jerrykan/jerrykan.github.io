</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hi people! For this month's Launceston meeting, we have Scott Bragg from
Hobart talking about how he merges Linux and open source with amateur radio.
Over the past months a group in Hobart have been tinkering with a new digital
transmission mode called FSQ and Scott has been building an automated beacon
using an Arduino, a clock generator, a RTLSDR dongle and a Raspberry Pi.<br>
Additionally, Craig Marshall from Hobart Makers will give a short update of
efforts to improve their recently acquired laser cutter by replacing the
control system with a Raspberry Pi, and asking for advice on the next steps to
get a good open source CAD/CAM workflow.  </p>
<p><strong>Where</strong><br>
Enterprize<br>
22-24 Patterson St  </p>
<p><strong>When</strong><br>
Saturday 27th May<br>
2:00pm Start  </p>
<p>As always, everybody is welcome to come along and join the discussion. Hope to
see you there!</p>                </article>
